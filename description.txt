Lamp Oil? Rope? Bombs? This NPC has it for you, my friend. As long as you spawn it by carrying a Ruby.

This mod adds two NPCs now!

Improved Sprites of The King and Morshu.
Party Hats now look good on the two!
Tweaked King's Loot a little.

Rebalanced Items sold to not ruin Vanilla feel.

Added Pixie Dust to the King's store.

Items in NPC stores now unlock while progressing.
